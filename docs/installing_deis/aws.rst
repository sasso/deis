:description: How to provision a multi-node Deis cluster on Amazon AWS

.. _deis_on_aws:

Amazon AWS
==========

In this tutorial, we will show you how to set up your own 3-node cluster on Amazon Web Services.

Please :ref:`get the source <get_the_source>` and refer to the scripts in `contrib/ec2`_
while following this documentation.


Install the AWS Command Line Interface
--------------------------------------

In order to start working with Amazon's API, let's install `awscli`_:

.. code-block:: console

    $ pip install awscli

We'll also need `PyYAML`_ for the Deis EC2 provision script to run:

.. code-block:: console

    $ pip install pyyaml


Configure aws-cli
-----------------

Run ``aws configure`` to set your AWS credentials:


.. code-block:: console

    $ aws configure
    AWS Access Key ID [None]: ***************
    AWS Secret Access Key [None]: ************************
    Default region name [None]: us-west-1
    Default output format [None]:


Upload keys
-----------

Generate and upload a new keypair to AWS, ensuring that the name of the keypair is set to "deis".

.. code-block:: console

    $ ssh-keygen -q -t rsa -f ~/.ssh/deis -N '' -C deis
    $ aws ec2 import-key-pair --key-name deis --public-key-material file://~/.ssh/deis.pub


Choose Number of Instances
--------------------------

By default, the script will provision 3 servers. You can override this by setting
``DEIS_NUM_INSTANCES``:

.. code-block:: console

    $ export DEIS_NUM_INSTANCES=5

Note that for scheduling to work properly, clusters must consist of at least 3 nodes and always
have an odd number of members. For more information, see `optimal etcd cluster size`_.

Deis clusters of less than 3 nodes are unsupported.


Generate a New Discovery URL
----------------------------

.. include:: ../_includes/_generate-discovery-url.rst


Customize cloudformation.json
-----------------------------

Any of the parameter defaults defined in deis.template.json can be overridden by setting the value
in `cloudformation.json`_ like so:

.. code-block:: console

    {
        "ParameterKey":     "InstanceType",
        "ParameterValue":   "m3.xlarge"
    },
    {
        "ParameterKey":     "KeyPair",
        "ParameterValue":   "jsmith"
    },
    {
        "ParameterKey":     "EC2VirtualizationType",
        "ParameterValue":   "PV"
    },
    {
        "ParameterKey":     "AssociatePublicIP",
        "ParameterValue":   "false"
    }

The only entry in cloudformation.json required to launch your cluster is `KeyPair`, which is
already filled out. The defaults will be applied for the other settings.

If updated with update-ec2-cluster.sh, the InstanceType will only impact newly deployed instances
(`#1758`_).

NOTE: The smallest recommended instance size is `large`. Having not enough CPU or RAM will result
in numerous issues when using the cluster.


Launch into an existing VPC
---------------------------

By default, the provided CloudFormation script will create a new VPC for Deis. However, the script
supports provisioning into an existing VPC instead. You'll need to have a VPC configured with an
internet gateway and a sane routing table (the default VPC in a region should be ready to go).

To launch your cluster into an existing VPC, export three additional environment variables:

 - ``VPC_ID``
 - ``VPC_SUBNETS``
 - ``VPC_ZONES``

``VPC_ZONES`` must list the availability zones of the subnets in order.

For example, if your VPC has ID ``vpc-a26218bf`` and consists of the subnets ``subnet-04d7f942``
(which is in ``us-east-1b``) and ``subnet-2b03ab7f`` (which is in ``us-east-1c``) you would export:

.. code-block:: console

    export VPC_ID=vpc-a26218bf
    export VPC_SUBNETS=subnet-04d7f942,subnet-2b03ab7f
    export VPC_ZONES=us-east-1b,us-east-1c

Change ELB Scheme
------------------------
For load balancers attached to an Amazon VPC, this parameter can be used to specify the type of load balancer to use. 
Specify internal to create an internal load balancer with a DNS name that resolves to private IP addresses or 
internet-facing to create a load balancer with a publicly resolvable DNS name, which resolves to public IP addresses.

.. code-block:: console

    export ELB_SCHEME=internet-facing|internal

Run the Provision Script
------------------------

Run the cloudformation provision script to spawn a new CoreOS cluster:

.. code-block:: console

    $ cd contrib/ec2
    $ ./provision-ec2-cluster.sh
    {
        "StackId": "arn:aws:cloudformation:us-west-1:413516094235:stack/deis/9699ec20-c257-11e3-99eb-50fa01cd4496"
    }
    Your Deis cluster has successfully deployed.
    Please wait for all instances to come up as "running" before continuing.

.. note::

    The default name of the CloudFormation stack will be ``deis``. You can specify a different name
    with ``./provision-ec2-cluster.sh <name>``.

Check the AWS EC2 web control panel and wait until "Status Checks" for all instances have passed.
This will take several minutes.


Configure DNS
-------------

See :ref:`configure-dns` for more information on properly setting up your DNS records with Deis.


Install Deis Platform
---------------------

Now that you've finished provisioning a cluster, please refer to :ref:`install_deis_platform` to
start installing the platform.
